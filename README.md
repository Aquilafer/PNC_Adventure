# PNC_Adventure
Final project for PHY 505

The aim of this project was to make a working gui. As of the time of this writing, I have a GUI that can display a picture and a lot of backend stuff for future functionality. In time, I hope to figure out how to get the GUI to do more than just one thing. When I do, I have a VERY small adventure game to be played.

I have a debug mode (set during compile time), but I have no practical way to test this thing. I mean, how do you autotest GUIs?

P.S. the pictures took me 20 minutes combined (and yes, I did make them in MSPaint); overall a tiny amount compared to how much I spent on the more important parts. The makefile alone took over an hour of fiddling to get working.
